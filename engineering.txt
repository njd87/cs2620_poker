To start with our project, we first need to do some restructuring.
We need new databases. Our user databases in setup.py can stay the same, but we change
messages to game_history to keep track of games and who played them. For simplicity and keeping track
of money, we assume accounts cannot be deleted at the moment (if we have time later, we will rework this).

The RAFT procedure for choosing leaders we know works from our unit tests from last time, so we are good on that front!
However, the ENTIRE chat application needs to be restructured. We have a different structure to our servers now. We have 5 "main"
backend server that keeps track of game history and player profiles. Then, each lobby is its own server that connects with the backend server leader.
So, the client no longer connects via the RAFT protocol after connecting to a lobby! It talks ONLY to the lobby. The lobby keeps track of the game logic as well
and tells the connected players how the game will be played.

These are a LOT of things that we need to change. Let's first start by changing up the grpc and client scheme following login.
Once a player logs in, they should be brought to the main menu. Then, once connected to the lobby, they work with the lobby.

So, we need 3 total services:
- Landing: When the client interacts with the backend servers for logging in, checking game history, etc.
- Poker: When the client is actually playing poker
- RAFT: finding new leaders
